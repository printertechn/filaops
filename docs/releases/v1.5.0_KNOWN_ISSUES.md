# Known Issues - v1.5.0

## ⚠️ Modal Initialization Errors (Development Build)

**Severity**: Medium  
**Affects**: Some modal dialogs and forms  
**Workaround**: Refresh the page or use incognito mode

### What's Happening

The community edition uses development mode builds (unminified) which occasionally causes "Cannot access before initialization" errors when opening certain modals for the first time.

**Confirmed affected components:**
- ✅ Items page - FIXED in v1.5.0
- ✅ RecordPaymentModal - FIXED in v1.5.0
- ⚠️ Other modals may still be affected (not yet tested)

### Workaround

If you encounter an error when opening a modal:
1. **Refresh the browser** (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)
2. Try the action again
3. Use **incognito/private browsing** to bypass cache if issue persists

### Technical Details

This is a known React hook timing issue where async functions are defined after the `useEffect` hooks that call them. This works fine in development but can cause initialization errors in some scenarios.

**We are actively working on fixing this** - tracking issue: [#TBD]

### When Will This Be Fixed?

- **Short term**: Fixing components as they're reported (~ongoing)
- **Long term**: Complete refactor of all components before SaaS launch (~Q1 2026)

This does NOT affect the core functionality - it's purely a timing issue on first load.

## 🔍 Browser Cache Issues

**Severity**: Low  
**Affects**: Development environments after updates

### Symptoms
- Old bundle loads after rebuilding
- Changes don't appear after `docker-compose up`

### Solution
- Use **incognito/private browsing mode** for testing
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache completely

## 📊 Bundle Size

**Note**: Development builds are ~2.1MB (vs ~1MB production)

This is intentional for the community edition to aid debugging and contributions. Performance impact is negligible for self-hosted deployments.
